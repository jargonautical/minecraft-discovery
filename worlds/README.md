###Minecraft worlds
Here are the Minecraft world files generated from postcodes submitted on the day. If you submitted a request and gave us your name then the world name will be your surname; if we didn't get your name, then the world is labelled using your postcode.

Each Minecraft world is made up of several folders and files, so they have been uploaded here in zip format. To get your world you need to download the zip file and unzip or uncompress it into your Minecraft <strong>saves</strong> folder.

######How to find the saves folder:

Launch Minecraft and select <strong>Play</strong>

Select <strong>Options</strong>

Select <strong>Resource Packs</strong>

Select <strong>Open Resource Packs Folder</strong>

This will open a File Manager or Finder window for a folder named <strong>resourcepacks</strong> - go up one level and you will see the <strong>saves</strong> folder in the containing folder (<strong>minecraft</strong>). This is where you want to put the unzipped world folder - move the whole thing over. Now relaunch Minecraft, select <strong>Single Player</strong> and you should see the name of your world appear in the list for you to choose.
