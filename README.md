###Storage of assets and scripts for Minecraft Discovery Day 12th March 2016

####Minecraft worlds
We'll be working on generating worlds based on the postcodes you've submitted, and when they're ready they will be placed in the <strong>worlds</strong> folder. You can also take a look the Ordnance Survey Minecraft map of Britain here:
https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/innovate/developers/minecraft-map-britain.html and the British Geological Survey map here: http://www.bgs.ac.uk/discoveringGeology/geologyOfBritain/minecraft/home.html#/6232/64/22413/-11/0/0.

If you feel like taking another look at the world we were playing with on the day, it's in the <strong>Exeter_Cathedral.zip</strong> file on this folder.
